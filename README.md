# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-MNIST-with-CNN-in-Python-using-Keras
This project implements and explains Python code to detect handwritten digits (MNIST dataset) with a CNN using Keras.  

#### Objective
- Understand how CNN helps by implementing first with MLP and then moving onto CNN
- Get a idea about CNN implementation in Python / Keras
